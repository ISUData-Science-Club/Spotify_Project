    "### Key Points\n",
    "In order to call Spotify's api, we need an access token. Spotify has documentation on how to do this, but simply speaking, we make an API call to a link that spotify provides and our token is returned(need to register an app with spotify first to gain the client ID and client secret). \n",
    "\n",
    "After we get the token, we can call most of spotify's API endpoints(we have a basic scope credential, which is beyond this project). We want to get information on songs, but the API endpoint for song information only takes a song id. How do we get the song id?\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to get a song's id is to use the 'search' API endpoint. This can take many parameters but we will be giving it song name and artist. The response we get will have that songs ID that we can use to get more information on that song.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we a way to get a song's ID based off of name and artist. We need a list of songs with their names and artists. This is where web scraping will come into play. Spotify has a list of weekly top songs and we can pull the song names and artists off of that and save them in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all this, we have what we need to build our data. The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. get a token\n",
    "2. get a list of songs using selenium to web scrape song name and artist\n",
    "3. get the IDs of each song in our list using the search API\n",
    "4. call the API endpoint for song data for each song(with ID) and save data in a list\n",
    "5. turn the list generated from step 4 into a dataframe\n",
    "6. celebrate cause the boring stuff is over"
